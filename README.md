In this project, I will analyze 7 factors that may or may not correlate with world happiness. 
The data comes from a 2019 Kaggle dataset collected from the World Happiness Report, which is a landmark survey of the state of global happiness. 
In this project, the data ranges from the years 2015 to 2017. 
All of the data used for this analysis project can be found in the master branch of this repository.
